Some documents that I wrote as part of my TA job at Stanford University.

### CME 104 - Spring 2018
I was a TA for Prof. Vadim Khayms' class, CME 104: Linear Algebra and Partial Differential Equations for Engineers. This undergraduate class (freshmen through senior) taught three weeks of linear algebra (LU decomposition, eigenvalue problem) followed by seven weeks of PDEs (Laplace, Poisson, heat, wave; 1D, 2D; homogeneous, non-homogeneous).

# Stanford TA
Some documents that I wrote as part of my TA job at Stanford University.

### CME 104 - Spring 2018

*Size: 30 students*

I was a TA for Prof. Vadim Khayms' class, CME 104: Linear Algebra and Partial
Differential Equations for Engineers. This undergraduate class for freshmen
through seniors taught three weeks of linear algebra (LU decomposition,
eigenvalue problem) followed by seven weeks of PDEs (Laplace, Poisson, heat,
wave; 1D, 2D; homogeneous, non-homogeneous). The class combines theory and
applications with MATLAB incorporated for numerical solutions and
visualizations.

### CME 100 - Fall 2018

*Size: 150 students*

I was a TA for Prof. Vadim Khayms' class, CME 100: Vector Calculus for
Engineers. This undergraduate class has primarily freshmen and sophomores, and
is a core course that is required by many if not all science and engineering
majors. The topics cover differential and integral multivariable calculus,
Cartesian, polar, and spherical coordinates, divergence, curl, Green's Theorem,
and Stokes' Theorem; along with a little bit of linear algebra. The class
combines theory and applications with MATLAB incorporated for numerical
solutions and visualizations.
